Vault backs up contacts, sms, photos and videos so that they can be restored when the phone is lost. Contacts can be added/edited/deleted on the server side as well and it will be synced with the client the next time it connects.

Secure allows the user to remotely lock the device and sound an alarm when the phone is lost. The user can also wipe out all personal information remotely. Secure is smart and locks up the phone when the SIM card is changed. It also sends out an sms from the new SIM so that the thief's identity is recorded.
